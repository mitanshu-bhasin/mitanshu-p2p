🚀 MITANSHU P2P ENGINE - ENTERPRISE SUITE v13.1 (Patched)

"Fuck nothing in life is achievable. You just need the right code and a rebellious mindset." Welcome to the ultimate, zero-trust, browser-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. Bina kisi creepy central server ke, direct device-to-device communication. Sirf ek HTML file mein poora Enterprise Suite pel diya hai tera bhai ne. No backend bullshit, no data harvesting—just pure, unadulterated WebRTC magic.

Designed and architected by Mitanshu Bhasin (Cyber Hygiene Practitioner & Python Elite).

🌪️ Features that make other apps cry

💬 Stealth Chat (E2E Encrypted): Koi third-party database nahi. Your messages go directly from your Asus laptop to your friend's screen. Snoopers gonna weep.

🎥 Full Duplex Video & Screen Share: Crystal clear video calling and screen sharing over direct WebRTC streams.

📍 Live Geo-Tracking (Map Module): Broadcast your live GPS coordinates directly to your peer. Powered by Leaflet.js. Tactical awareness on point.

📁 God-Level File Transfer: Bhejo kitni bhi badi file. It uses advanced array buffer chunking to bypass standard WebRTC limits. No size limits, all formats supported.

💻 In-Browser Code Studio: P2P chat ke saath coding? Hell yeah. Built-in Ace Editor with real-time execution for:

Python: Running directly in the browser using Pyodide (Kyuki tera bhai Python Elite hai).

SQL: In-memory queries via Alasql.

HTML5: Live preview frame.

🛠️ The Tech Stack (Under the Hood)

Pura system frontend-heavy aur hyper-optimized hai. Here is what's running this beast:

Core Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, WebRTC.

Networking: PeerJS (for WebRTC signaling and connection abstraction).

UI/UX: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) with custom Glassmorphism panels and responsive mobile-first design.

Heavy Lifting Libs:

Leaflet.js (Maps)

Ace Editor (Code Studio)

Pyodide (WASM Python Engine)

Alasql (WASM SQL Engine)

Icons: FontAwesome 6.4

⚡ How to Run this Beast

Bhai, it's literally just one file.

Clone the repo or just download the index.html file.

Double-click the index.html file to open it in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave recommended).

Wait for the engine to initialize and give you a Digital ID.

Share your Link/ID with your peer.

They enter your ID (or click your auto-connect link) and boom—you are linked in the matrix.

Pro-Tip: Host this on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for the ultimate shareable URL experience. The app has a built-in auto-connect feature if you pass ?peer=YOUR_ID in the URL!
